This is the first release after the founder, developer and project lead of Jamulus, Volker Fischer (@corrados), [decided to leave the project](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions/928).
We want to use this opportunity to thank Volker again. Creating Jamulus and pushing it to the point where it is today was and is a huge accomplishment! Thanks, Volker!

Starting with this release, the project will be lead by the Main Developers Team.

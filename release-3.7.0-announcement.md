We're excited to announce the availability of Jamulus 3.7.0!

This release re-organizes Server lists to make room for more servers:
- Default has been renamed to Any Genre 1.
- Any Genre has been renamed to Any Genre 2.
- Any Genre 3 has been added.
- Choral/Barbershop has been added.
- Classical/Folk/Choral has been renamed to Classical/Folk.

Besides that, numerous usability improvements, enhancements, bugfixes and optimizations have been integrated.
Please find all the details in the [Changelog](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/releases/tag/r3_7_0).

Note: If you are using ASIO4ALL, we strongly suggest that you take a screenshot of your ASIO4ALL settings before upgrading.
The installer will try its best to migrate your settings, but it may fail to do so when using custom installation paths.

This is the first release after the founder, developer and project lead of Jamulus, Volker Fischer (@corrados), [decided to leave the project](https://github.com/jamulussoftware/jamulus/discussions/928).
We want to use this opportunity to thank Volker again. Creating Jamulus and pushing it to the point where it is today was and is a huge accomplishment! Thanks, Volker!

Starting with this release, the project will be led by the Main Developers Team.
